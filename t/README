This is the Template::Latex unit test directory.

It contains the unit test files and the directories:

    lib     contains a test helper module
    input   contains test input files
    output  this is the destination for testing of generated DVI/PS/PDF documents

The unit test 11-plugin-errors.t is does not yet pass - the errors are
in the test script. I have marked the script as skip_all until I get
round to sorting out the tests again.
