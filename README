DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Template Toolkit is a collection of modules which implement a
fast, flexible, powerful and extensible template processing system.
The LaTeX plugin provides the facility to filter content through
LaTeX, provided of course that the content is valid LaTeX source.  

The LaTeX plugin takes care of running and re-running latex so that
forward references, tables of contents, and lists of figures and
tables are resolved.  It will also run bibtex and makeindex if it
detects that a bibliography or in index have been specified, and will
re-run latex again one or more times until the formatting of the
document has stabilized.  (This functionality is new in version 3.00
of the module.)



QUICK START
-----------

The latest version of the Template Toolkit LaTeX Plugin can be
retrieved from:

    http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Template-Latex/

Fetch and install Template Toolkit (2.16 or newer) if you don't
already have it installed.  Available from CPAN in:

    http://www.cpan.org/authors/Andy_Wardley/

To install the Template Toolkit Latex Plugin:

    tar zxf Template-Latex-3.00_05.tar.gz
    cd Template-Latex-3.00_05
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install    

The Makefile.PL will prompt for additional configuration options,
including the installation of optional template libraries, HTML
documentation and examples.  You can safely answer 'n' to all of these
questions for a quick and basic installation.  

If you're running ActivePerl on a Win32 platform then you can use the
Perl Package Manager (PPM) to install the Template Toolkit.  Chris
Winters maintains a repository of pre-compiled PPM packages which contains
the Template Toolkit, AppConfig and others.  For further information, see:

    http://openinteract.sourceforge.net/


For further details on installation, see the separate INSTALL file.


WHAT'S NEW?
-----------

Version 3.00 is a complete rewrite of Template-Latex.

Version 2.16 was the first release of Template-Latex.  It was created
by moving the code out of the core Template Toolkit distribution
(version 2.15).

See the Changes file for further details of the changes in these
releases.
